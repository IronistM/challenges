# Challenges

A collection of introductory coding challenges that cover algorithms, data
structures, software engineering (especially version control and unit testing),
and and data cleaning/visualization.

They were originally given to the Data Analyst team at Brandwatch on "Funky
Fridays". These are days when the engineering team were doing personal projects
(roughly equivalent to Google's 20% time). The idea was to allow the analyst
team to pick up some important data science skills, and to be more
culturally/professionally integrated with the engineering team.
